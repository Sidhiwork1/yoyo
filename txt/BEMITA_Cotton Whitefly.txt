Cotton whitefly Questions & Responses for AI


Q1. How will we identify white fly and its infestation in cotton field?
Answer- Identification - Nymphs are yellowish and brownish, sub elliptical and scale like. They are found in large numbers on underside of leaves. Adults are tiny and white in colour. They have a yellow body dusted lightly with a white waxy powder. Females are 1.1 –1.2 mm long; males are slightly smaller.
Infestation- Leaves curl upwards and the plant vigour reduces. Leaves become shiny with honeydew or darkened by sooty mould growing on honeydew
Q2. What is the colour of cotton whitefly?
Answer- Nymphs are yellowish and brownish & adults are White in colour.
Q3. Which part of the cotton plant mostly affected by whitefly?
Answer- Leaves are mostly affected by whitefly.
Q4. How whitefly damage the cotton plants?
Answer- Both nymphs and adults suck the cell sap from the leaves which turn pale, curl and dry up. They secrete honeydew on leaves that invites black sooty mould. Ants are also attracted to the honeydew.
Q5. What are the economic losses happened due to whitefly?
Answer- Damage from direct feeding reduces the photosynthetic activities of the plant and hence the yield. Indirect damage results from lint contamination with honeydew and associated fungi and through transmission of leaf curl virus disease. Late season severity affects the seed development and the lint quality.
