Crop: Rice
Name of Disease:  Rice Blast Disease caused by Rice blast fungus- Magnaporthe oryzae
Host Range: Rice, wheat, barley, maize, millets, grasses and sedges.
Disease Distribution: Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Orissa, Manipur, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh Jammu and Kashmir, Meghalaya, Tripura and Northern districts of West Bengal. 
Pathogen Etiology, Life cycle & Biology: 
The fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is an ascomycete as it produces sexual spores (ascospores) in structures called asci. The perfect state of the fungus produces perithecia and the asci are found within these perithecia. The asci are unitunicate. The ascospores are hyaline, fusiform (spindle-shaped with tapering ends) and with three septa or 4 celled and slightly curved. The mycelium of M. oryzae is hyaline and septate, and the nuclei within the mycelium and spores of this fungus are haploid. Conidia are produced in clusters on long septate, olivaceous conidiophores. Conidia are pyriform to ellipsoid, and are hyaline to pale olive green, usually 3 celled. 
Symptoms of disease: The fungus attacks the crop at all stages of crop growth from seedling to late tillering and ear heading stage. Symptoms appear on leaves, nodes, rachis, and glumes.
Leaf blast: The characteristic symptoms of the disease appear on the leaf and leaf sheath as brown spindle shaped lesions. The lesions resembles to eye or boat shaped with gray or dark brown margins. The lesions in older leaves remain circular but on young leaves they enlarge up to several centimeters long and about 1 cm broad. The spots coalesce as the disease progresses and large areas of the leaves dry up and wither. Spots also appear on sheath. Severely infected nursery and field appear as burnt. Leaf blast can kill rice plants at seedling stage and cause yield losses in cases of severe infection.
Collar blast: Collar refers to the junction of the leaf and leaf sheath. Collar infections can kill the entire leaf and may extend a few millimetres into and around the sheath. The fungus may produce spores on these lesions.
Node blast: Stem nodes may be attacked as the plant approaches maturity, causing the plant to break at the point of infection. Diseased nodes are brown or black. Black lesions appear on nodes girdling them. The affected nodes may break up and all the plant parts above the infected nodes may die (nodal blast). Nodal infection causes the culm to break at the infected area. Inter nodal infection also occurs at the base of the plant which causes white panicles similar to that induced by yellow stem borer or water deficit
Neck blast: Brown to black spots or rings are formed on the rachis of the maturing inflorescence. The neck becomes shriveled and covered with grey fluffy mycelium. If the infection has occurred much before the grain formation the latter are not filled and the panicles remain erect; but if the attack takes place after some grains have formed the panicle hangs down. This stage of the disease causes maximum damage. Panicle branches and glumes can also be attacked. Lesions on the neck are grayish brown and causes the girdling of the neck and the panicle to fall over. If infection of the neck occurs before milky stage, no grain is formed, but if infection occurs later, grains of poor quality are formed. Lesions on the branches of the panicles and on the spikelet pedicels are brown to dark brown. The size and shape of the spots vary on different rice varieties.
Mode of Survival & Spread: 
The pathogen survives as mycelium and conidia on diseased straw, seeds, rice ratoons, volunteer rice plants and weed hosts. The initiation of the primary infection process begins with the attachment of the conidium of M. oryzae to the leaf cuticle. Later stages of the infection process include the formation of appressorium and it assists in pathogen penetration, generation of turgor, formation of penetration peg, and finally penetration into host tissue. After penetration, hyphae grow through the plant tissue, resulting in the disease lesions and rice blast symptoms. The sporulation continues for several days and provides the inoculum (secondary conidia) for secondary infection. Under congenial weather conditions, the fungus produces enormous number of conidia which brings the secondary spread and infection to other healthy plants nearby and spreads rapidly to adjacent fields by wind and dewdrops leading to field epidemic. 
Favourable Conditions of Pathogen: 
High relative humidity and low night temperature, low soil moisture, frequent and prolonged periods of rain shower, and cool temperature in the daytime. In upland rice, large day-night temperature differences that cause dew formation on leaves and overall cooler temperatures favour the development of the disease. 
ETL Levels: 
Foliar blast 3-5 lesions/leaf: Early to late tillering
Neck blast 2-5 neck infected plants/m2: Panicle initiation to booting

Cultural Practices
1. The primary control option for blast is to plant resistant varieties. Local agriculture office for up-to-date lists of available resistant varieties should be contacted.
2. Use of disease free seeds and seed treatment with approved biopesticides or chemical pesticides before sowing.
3. Remove and destroy the weed hosts in the field bunds and channels. Weeds like panicum repens, Leersia, Echinochloa, Digitaria etc. should be removed from nearby areas of rice fields as these serves as alternative host for the pathogen.
4. Burn previously blast affected straw and stubbles.
5. Adjust planting time. Sow seeds early, when possible, after the onset of the rainy season. Sowing and planting stages should be adjusted in such a way that the seedling and active tillering stages of the crop growth should not fall during 3rd week of September to 2nd week of November in Kharif season and 2nd week of February to 1st week of April in Rabi season as these periods are most vulnerable for blast development.
6. Avoid close spacing as it often increases the severity of the disease. 
7. High doses of nitrogenous fertilizers (more than 60 kg per hectare) should not be used. Split nitrogen fertilizer application in two or more treatments. (Apply N in three split doses (50% basal, 25% in tillering phase and 25% N in panicle initiation stage). Potash and phosphorus should be used (30 kg/hect each) along with nitrogenous fertilizer to reduce the epidemic. 
8. Silicon fertilizers (e.g., calcium silicate) can be applied efficiently to soils that are silicon deficient to reduce blast. Cheap sources of silicon, such as straws of rice genotypes with high silicon content, can be used as an alternative. Care should be taken to ensure that the straw is free from blast as the fungus can survive on rice straw and the use of infected straw as a silicon source can spread the disease further.
9. Irrigation Management: Moisture content of the soil also affects the susceptibility of rice plants to the blast pathogen. Moreover, plants grown under well irrigated fields are less prone to blast than plants which are grown under less irrigated or drought-stressed condition.
