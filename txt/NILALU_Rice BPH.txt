Crop: Rice
Name of Pest:Brown Plant Hopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens
Host Range: Rice, Wheat and wild grasses
Pest Distribution: Kerala,(Kole lands of Trichur district and Kuttanad area in Kottayam and Alleppy districts), Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, northern districts of West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore), Karnataka,UttarPradesh, Bihar, Haryana, and Punjab.
Pest Identification features/Morphology: 
* Egg:The eggs of BPH are white; transparent cylindrical and are arranged in 2 straight lines
* Nymph:Freshly hatched nymph is cottony white, 0.6 mm long and it turns purple-brown, 3.0 mm long in the fifth instar.
* Adult:Adult hopper is 4.5-5.0 mm long and has a yellowish brown to dark brown body. The wings are sub hyaline with a dull yellowish tint. 
Life Cycle& Biology:
* Egg: The female can lay eggs ranging between 100 and 500 eggs.The eggs are laid in a group of 2 to 12 in leaf sheath (near the plant base or in the ventral midribs of leaf blades). (They are covered with a dome - shaped egg plug secreted by the female. Only the tips protrude from the plant surface). Female can lay up to 650 during its life time. The hatching period of the egg varies from 5-8 days.
* Nymph:Freshly hatched nymph is cottony white, 0.6 mm long and it turns purple-brown, 3.0 mm long in the fifth instar. The nymphal period of BPH varies between 12 to 15 days.
* Adult: Adult hopper is 4.5-5.0 mm long and has a yellowish brown to dark brown body. The wings are sub hyaline with a dull yellowish tint. This stage has two characteristic wing morphs: macropterous (long winged) and brachypterous (short winged). Macopterous adults can fly for a long distance while brachypterous adults are adapted for reproduction and produce numerous offspring. They live usually for about 10-21 days.
Symptoms of damage:BPH causes adverse effects on paddy plants at all stages of growth. BPH damages the plant directly by sucking to plant phloem sap and indirectly by transmitting viral diseases like grassy stunts and ragged stunts. The pest feeds directly on the growing plant, reducing its yield potential. If the pest density is high, the plant dies and a condition known as hopper burn occurs (yellowing, browning and drying of plant).Circular patches of drying and lodging of matured plants are observed in the field. Nymphs and adults congregate at the base of the plant above the water level.Affected plant dries up and gives a scorched appearance called “hopper burn”.At this level, crop loss may be 100%. Hopper burn caused by the plant hoppers is distinguished from other hopper burn symptom by the presence of visible sooty molds at the bases of the rice plant. Virus infected plants may also be found. In field conditions, plants nearing maturity can have hopper burns if infested with about 400−500 BPH nymphs.
ETL Levels:
Early to late tillering: 10-15 hoppers/hill
Panicle initiation to booting:15-20 hoppers/hill
Favourable Conditions of Pest: 
High humidity (>90%) with temperature of 25-32 oC, Excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizer (more than recommended),  Closer crop canopy, Indiscriminate use of pesticides especially at the early stage of the crop which kill their natural enemies and continuous submerged condition in the field favours the buildup of BPH population. 
Management Practices: 
Resistant varieties:Vijetha, Chaitanay, Krishnaveni, Pratibha, Vajram, Makom, Pavizham, Mansarovar, CO 42,Jyoti, Chandana, Nagarjuna, Sonasali, Rasmi, Neela, Annanga, Daya, Bhadra, Karthika, Aruna, Remya, Kanakam, Bharathidasan, Remya, Triguna, IET 8116, Rajendra Mahsuri-l, Pant dhan 11, Rajshree, Bhudeb and Hanseshwari.(Local agriculture office should be contactedfor up-to-date lists of available resistant varieties).
Cultural control
Before planting:
* Choose resistantvarieties or varieties that have tolerance to the brown plant hopper.Local agriculture office should be contacted for up-to-date lists of available resistant varieties.
* Avoid staggered planting, preventing plant hoppers moving from older to younger crops in ever greater numbers. Plant at the same time as neighbors, within a period of 2-3 weeks.
* Remove volunteer plants/weeds.
* Rotate rice with other crops. Do not plant rice crops one after another so that large populations of the brown plant hopper can migrate easily between them.
During growth:
* Drain the paddies for 3-4 days during the early stage of infestation.
* Apply split applications (three times) of nitrogen fertilizer, not all at one time.
* Allow plants (weeds) on the bunds (and at the borders of dryland crops), and between fields, to flower in order to attract natural enemies. 
* Avoid indiscriminate use of insecticide, which destroys natural enemies.
* Look for BPH daily in the seedbed, or weekly in the field, on stems and the water surface. Check each side of the seed bed (ordirect-seeded fields). For older rice plants, grasp the plant, bend it over slightly, and gently tap it near the base to see if plant hoppers fall onto the water surface. For transplanted rice look at bases of 10 to 20 hills as you cross the field diagonally.
After harvest:
* Plough the field after harvest, removing the stubble that would otherwise allow the brown planthoppers to continue to breed.


Mechanical & physical measures
1. Collection of egg masses and larvae of pest to be placed in bamboo cages for conservation of biocontrol agents.
2. Flood the seedbed, for a day, so that only the tips of seedlings are exposed which will control BPH.
3. Use light traps (e.g., an electric bulb or kerosene lamp near a light colored wall or over a pan of water) at night when rice is prone to plant hopper attack. Do not place lights near seedbeds or fields. If the light trap is inundated with hundreds of BPH, it's a signal to check your seedbed or field immediately; then scout every day for the next few weeks.


Biological methods
   1. If natural enemies out-number BPH the risk of hopper burn is low. Even rice already     damaged by hopper burn should not be treated with insecticides if natural enemies out-number BPH.
   2. Natural enemies of BPH include water striders, mirid bugs, spiders, and various egg parasitoids.


Parasitoids: 
Egg parasitoids:
1. Gonatocerus spp.- Parasitize on an average 8 eggs per day
2. Anagrus spp. - Parasitizes 15 to 30 eggs/day.
3. Oligosita spp. -Consume 2 to 8 eggs per day.
Larval parasitoids
Pseudogonatopus spp.-Pseudogonatopus attack plant hoppers and act as parasites and predators. Adults of Pseudogonatopus are brown or black in colour. Females are wingless with pincher like front claws.
Predators: 
Coccinellid beetles-
Micraspis hirashimai, Ladybird beetles - Preying on small hoppers and exposed eggs 
Harmonia octamaculata - Preying on small hoppers and exposed eggs
Carabid beetle-
Ophionea nigrofasciata, Ground beetle - Preying planthoppers
Rove beetle-
Paederus fuscipes Rove beetle - Preying planthoppers, eggs. 
Spiders
Pardosapsuedoannulata, Wolf spider - Prey plant hoppers,
Oxyopesjavanus, Lynx spider - Prey plant hoppers 
Tetragnathamaxillosa, Long-jawed spider - Prey plant hoppers
