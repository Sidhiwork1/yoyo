Life Cycle & Biology: 
The life cycle of YSB comprises of four stages i.e., egg, larva, pupa and adult stages. In cooler climates, diapause occurs in larval stage.
Egg: Eggs are laid on upper-surface and upper half of leaves in groups. Adult female moth lays between 150 to 600 eggs deposited in three or four oval masses of 50 to 200 eggs each. Egg masses are covered with brownish velvety hair obtained from the hair on the abdomen. Egg incubation takes between 5 to 9 days at optimum temperatures of 24 to 29°C.
Larva: The larvae usually undergo four to seven larval instar stages to become full grown. at 23-35°C. Within 2 h of egg hatch, almost all the newly hatched larvae will have either entered the leaf sheaths of the plant on which they enclosed or will have dispersed to other plants. After1 week, some larvae move to other plants or other tillers of the same plant. At optimum temperatures, larvae complete development in 17 to 27 days. The larvae become dormant if dry periods occur or in seasons when rice is not grown. During rice-free times, the larvae remain in the stubble below the soil. Mortality is high (90%) during periods of dormancy, due to destruction of stubble, and possibly due to predation by spiders and adverse environments.
Pupa: They pupate in white silk cocoons made in hollow stems at the base of the plant. The pupa is yellowish white with a tinge of green. It turns dark brown just before adult emergence. Pupation occurs in the rice stems or stubble and lasts about 9 to 12 days.
Adult: Adults exhibit remarkable sexual dimorphism. Yellow stem borer undergoes three or more generations in a season. Most borer species are capable of flying only a short distance; however, they can travel 8-16 km if carried by wind.
Female moth: The female moth is straw coloured with a conspicuous single black spot at the center towards lower angle of each of the fore wings while hind wings are pale straw coloured. The tip of the abdomen of female is covered with tufts of yellowish silken hairs forming a circle around a ventral opening. YSB adult females emerge near the time that rice is tillering and live for 7 to 10 days.
Male moth: Male moths are smaller grey or light-brown with 8-9 small dark spots near the tip of the forewing and five along the sub-terminal area. Abdomen is slender, anal end has a thin hairy structure covering dorsally. 


Symptoms of damage: 
Yellow stem borer is a major pest of tropical lowland and deep-water rice. It attacks all stages of the crop. Larva bores into central shoot of paddy seedling and tiller, causing drying and death of the central shoot known as “dead heart”. If infestation occurs in grown up plant, the whole panicle becomes dried with chaffy spikelets (without grains) and can be easily pulled out which is known as “white ears”. Affected shoots and panicles could be easily pulled by hand. Presence of brown coloured egg mass near leaf tip can also be seen.


ETL Levels: 
Nursery: 1 egg-mass/ mtr. sq.
Early to late tillering: 2 egg-mass/mtr. sq. or 10% dead heart or 1 moth/m2 or 25 moths/ trap/week.
Panicle initiation to booting: 2 egg-mass/mtr. sq. or 1 moth/mtr. sq. or 25 moths / trap / week


Favourable Conditions of Pest:  Drop in mean temperature (< 28° C) in association with continuous rain was found to be the congenial weather condition for outbreak of stem borer on rice.
Management Practices: 
1. Resistant varieties, cultivars developed: Ratna, Sasyasree, Vikas, HKR 46, NDGR 21, Pantdhan 6, VLK 39, Prahlad, Birsadhan 201, Bhudeb Ainesh, Matangini, Radha, Sudha, Amulya, Bhagirathi, Jogan, Mandira, Nalini, Sabita, VL16 and VL 206.




2. Cultural Practices:
* The primary control option for the control of YSB is the use of resistant varieties. Local agriculture office should be contacted for up-to-date lists of available resistant varieties.
* Seed treatment with approved biopesticides or chemical pesticides before sowing.
* Remove and destroy the grass weed hosts in the field bunds, channel or nearby areas of rice fields as these serves as alternative host for the pest.
* Avoid close spacing as it often increases the easy movement of pest. 
* Handpick and destroy egg masses in the seedbed (nursery) before transplanting the field.
* Before transplanting, cut the leaf-top to reduce carry-over of eggs from the seedbed to the field.
* Raise level of irrigation water periodically to submerge any eggs deposited on the lower parts of the plant.
* Cut out the stems with dead hearts and remove from the field. Destroy the larvae or burn the stems. 
* Split applications of nitrogen fertiliser. High nitrogen application favours build-up of stem borers.
* Rice varieties with short stature and shorter growth duration periods suffer less damage than long growth duration varieties. 
* Rice with shorter growth duration varieties suffer less damage than long duration varieties. This may be because of stem-borer mortality due to harvests occurring twice in the double cropping system. 
* Community-wide destruction of diapausing larvae (in stubble) through tillage after harvest, followed by flooding, reduces stem borer populations resulting in low incidence in the next crop
* Planting or seeding times may be delayed to avoid the peak emergence of moths from the diapausing populations.
* Rice seedbeds may be used as a trap crop for moths emerging from diapause


3. Mechanical/Physical practices:  
* Collection of egg masses and larvae of pest to be placed in bamboo cages for conservation of biocontrol agents. 
* Removal and destruction (burn) of pest infested plant parts. 
* Clipping of rice seedlings tips at the time of transplanting to minimize carryover of stem borer infestation from seed bed to the transplanted fields
* Mass trapping by installing pheromone traps @ 20 traps/ha with lures containing 10-15 mg pheromone at 20 days after transplanting
* Install light trap @ 1 / ha.


4. Biological methods (Including use of predators, parasites, botanicals, microbial biocontrol agents, pest specific natural enemies)
* Trichogramma japonicum and T chilonis may be released @ 1 lakh/ha on appearance of egg masses / moth of yellow stem borer and leaf folder in the field.
* Natural biocontrol agents such as spiders, drynids, water bugs, mirid bugs, damsel flies, dragonflies, meadow grasshoppers, staphylinid beetles, carabids, coccinellids, Apanteles, Tetrastichus, Telenomus, Trichogramma, Bracon, Platygaster etc. should be conserved. 
* Collection of egg masses of borers and putting them in a bamboo cage-cum-percher till flowering which will permit the escape of egg parasites and trap and kill the hatching larvae. Besides, these would allow perching of predatory birds. 
* Habitat management: Protection of natural habitats within the farm boundary may help in conserving natural enemies of pests. Management of farmland and rice bunds with planting of flowering weeds like marigold, sun hemp increases beneficial natural enemy population and also reduce the incidence of root knot nematodes. Provide refuge like straw bundles having charged with spiders to help in build-up spider population and to provide perch for birds.


Parasitoids:


Egg parasitoid: Trichogramma japonicum, Trichogramma chilonis, Tetrastichus schoenobii (At least 3 stem borer eggs are needed for development of each wasp), Telenomus rowani (A female parasitizes 20-40 eggs and lives 2-4 days or longer if nectar or sugar solution is provided).
Larval parasitoids: Amauromorpha accepta, Cotesia flavipes
Larval and pupal parasitoids: Xanthopimpla flavolineata


Predators: Spiders- Pardosa psuedoannulata (Wolf spider), Tetragnatha maxillosa (Long-jawed spider).
